  - codename: "E1"
    name: "Functional Group/Substituent Error"
    definition: >
      The LLM incorrectly described a substructure within a given molecule,
      including misidentifying the type or name of substituents or functional groups,
      incorrectly describing the connectivity between substructures, or mistakenly
      claiming the presence of a substructure that does not actually exist.

      - input_smiles: "C1=CC(=CC=C1C[C@@H](C(=O)O)NS(=O)(=O)O)O"
        problematic_description: >
          The molecule contains a carboxylic acid group, a sulfonamide group,
          and a phenol group.
        problem: >
          The substructure attached to the beta carbon of the carboxyl group
          does not satisfy the definition of a sulfonamide; it is actually
          a sulfo group.

          a furan ring fused to a phenol moiety.
        problem: >
